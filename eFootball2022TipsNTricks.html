<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Tips players should follow going into eFootball 2022</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are some tips that you can follow to prepare for the new season of eFootball on your devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Release your carryover which you do not play with. Even though you get their release value going into eFootball 2022, it is better to make space for base players so that they get retained in the coming season.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Release unwanted players. Releasing them will give you a lot of slots. Here, you start opening agents that are in your inventory. Since they are going to be completely erased from the game without any replacement GP, it is better you slowly empty the hoarded agents and get GP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Claim your inbox items. Else, they will all perish. You might also find many buried Coins or eFootball Points while digging, so better you follow this. You can, however, afford to keep a few trainers so when you claim a new player in PES 2021, you can train him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. If you are having trainers and agents in abundance, the best way to earn GP is to train players and then release them. Sounds hectic, but since there is a lot of time going into the update, you can do it with ease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. To get the highest GP from Trainers, keep 100 5â˜… trainers in your Trainer Inventory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. Do not use your Skill Items or Boosts if there is no requirement, thinking they would be removed. They will get GP as the return of removal, and the skills you gift the players will not carryover.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. Do not release any of your Managers. You will, in return, get the GP that you&rsquo;ve spent on each.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br><strong>Main Features of eFootball 2022 :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cross-Gen matches</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As mentioned during the release, players can now play cross-platform matches. So, a mobile player can opt to play against a PC/Console player while having the option of controller support for his device to balance the game. Players used to have UE4 for mobile and Fox Engine for Console, and with all the platforms having the same engine in eFootball 2022, it might be seen as unfair for all the players as each platform has its own advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Match Pass</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, this has to be very clear that one or the other day all might have thought this coming. It is because this system is so popular among the fans of any game, so every game is introducing its own kind of a &ldquo;Gift Pass&rdquo; system. Here too, KONAMI has played smart and are coming with the Match Pass, with both Free and Purchasable. With every match you play, you&rsquo;ll have the chance to earn rewards like the &ldquo;Nominating Contract&ldquo;, which allows you to sign a player of your choosing, among other items. You can purchase an &ldquo;Advantage Match Pass&rdquo; using eFootball Coins to get even more items.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>New Objectives</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These shall include tasks that a player should complete over a specific period of time or without a time limit that will get fetch them rewards. These also will be separated for Campaign and on a weekly basis. Another type existing within objectives is the Premium Objectives, which can be unlocked using eFootball Coins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>eFootbal Creative League</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Something new coming this season, which allows players to play PvP matches against evenly-matched opponents and gather points to rise the Divisions. Players will gain rewards based on their performance during a round and their final standing at the end of a phase. Each round will consist of 10 matches. By the looks of it, it looks like a FIFAesque division theme, where players will rank at each tier based on their performances. With online ratings not having any rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Master League</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those who were anticipating something new, the producer of the eFootball 2022 game, Seitaro Kimura, had confirmed that the upcoming eFootball 2022 edition for mobile will feature Master League in his interview for Gamer Japan. We can expect some tweaks and changes to balance out for the mobile version compared to the PC/Console versions, and then get a release on a later date even after the initial eFootball 2022 mobile release.</p>
