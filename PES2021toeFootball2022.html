<p style="text-align: justify;">The game items we currently have will be undergoing some changes, most noticeably new looks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">eFootball coins and currency details</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as in-game currency is concerned, the GP system and eFootball Points will be continued with the same title, but MyClub coins will be renamed to eFootball coins once eFootball 2022 is live. They will still have the same application like they used to, players can use eFootball Coins to pull players or even purchase the &ldquo;Match Pass&rdquo;. eFootball Coins will continue as the main currency in the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the role of GP seems to be minimal after the update compared to PES 2021. Previously, players had the chance to sign top players like Legends via GP, but this time it will not be the case. Only Managers and Regular Players can be signed via GP. eFootball Points continue to remain a &ldquo;earn, redeem, reward&rdquo; policy within the game. These eFootball points expire after 6 months from the date of acquisition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Players and new categories</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Legend Player and Iconic Moments will fall under one single category. They will come to eFootball 2022 under an expired contract status, which means they need to renew to get them on to the pitch. For every Iconic Moment, you known, a Contract Renewal item is obtained that can renew a player for up to 60 days. Base and Featured players are coming under the Standard Player category. Interesting points to note:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Players not included in eFootball 2022 at launch will not be carried over. This can be of any card type. As compensation, players will receive GP equal to the amount gained when releasing those players in eFootball PES 2021.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Some players included in eFootball PES 2021 but not included in eFootball 2022 at launch may be added to the game at a later date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. If a Base Player in eFootball PES 2021 is not included in eFootball 2022, but has a Standard player (ACL) counterpart with the same name, that player will be exchanged for the ACL version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. If a Base Player (ACL) in eFootball PES 2021 is not included in eFootball 2022, but has a non-ACL Standard player counterpart with the same name, that player will be exchanged for the non-ACL version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until last year, Carryover players were a popular figure in the game for obvious reasons. Firstly, they would exist as a player from last year which can be used in events or such. Next, they used to fetch a lot of GP when they get released. This time around, there is no such thing. Four types of players are the new norm from the upcoming season: Standard, Trending, Featured and Legendary. Details of each type are given below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Standard.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Base players from PES 2021 are the standard players. Your Featured and Base players from PES 2021 after the carryover will be Standard Players in eFootball 2022. They will continue to be affected via live updates, so form A, B, C, D, and E will still remain in the game. They can be purchased from eFootball Coins, GP, and Chance Deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Trending.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, this is interesting. These players will be based on a specific match or week in which they put an impressive performance during the season. Sounds like featured? Yes, they are but they are not. They will come as Players of the Week. Sorry to confuse you, but still they can be considered as featured players, but in this case, Trending Players are not subject to training. These players cannot be trained, which means they can&rsquo;t be developed any further. Their stats will stay as it is and can be signed only via a &ldquo;Nominating Contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Featured.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If Trending Players in eFootball 2022 are the new Featured from PES 2021, what are Featured Players then? Based on Seasonal performances, they are selected, and they can be developed by training. They can come as Club agents too, so keep your eyes on them. Also, they can be acquired by eFootball Coins, eFootball Points via Nominating Contract, and a Chance Deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Legendary.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your current IMs and Legend cards will be converted to one single card type &ldquo;Legendary&ldquo;, and they will start at level 1 with an expired contract. The biggest debate of them all, that is no mention of how Iconic Moments will be implemented alongside Legend cards of PES 2021, but there is this new single category of player cards. As per first looks, Legend cards from PES 2021 are considered Legendary, but still, it has a 4* rating on the card design. That has confused a lot of players.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But here is something that players should notice, previously legend cards were affiliated to their nationalities only, but this time, you can notice there is a club emblem in the player design. So, this means, based on age and club, a version of a Legendary card is chosen and then released to claim. They can be acquired by eFootball Coins, eFootball Points via Nominating Contract, and a Chance Deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Player contracts and Signing</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will try out best to break down the contract systems that KONAMI has presented in their carryover guide for eFootball 2022.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nominating Contract</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nominating Contract is an item that allows you to sign a player of your choosing from a list of players tailored for this contract. It is like redeeming a player from the store using eFootball Points, or even players using GP. You can get all kinds of players via Nominating Contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chance Deal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, except for Trending Players, you can claim the rest of the types via a Chance Deal. In terms of the contract, all the players will receive 10 contract items after they update the game.</p>
